            <figcaption>Full speed ahead - but to where?</figcaption>

        <p>Technological fundamentalism is everywhere. But we rarely call it by its name. It's that unquestioned belief that no matter what crisis we face - be it climate collapse, resource depletion, or society falling apart - technology will swoop in and save the day. It's the strong belief that limits don't really exist, that human ingenuity can always outmaneuver reality, and that slowing down, pausing, or reconsidering the direction we're heading in is an act of heresy.</p>

        <p>"Europe must keep pace!" declares politician after politician, echoing in whitepapers and tech forums alike. This is a phrase repeated endlessly these days. But “keep pace” with what, exactly? A society that demands perpetual acceleration, no matter the cost? With an arms race of technological development that serves its own momentum rather than human well-being? With market forces that know no boundary other than the next quarter's profits? The race itself is the problem. This isn't just a flaw in policy, it's baked into how we measure success, design incentives, and tell stories about progress. We are so fixated on keeping up that we forget to ask where, exactly, we are going. And when someone dares to suggest we should slow down, or even stop for a moment to reconsider, they are met with alarm.</p>
        
        <p>This fear of limits runs deep. To acknowledge that there might be constraints - on growth, on energy, on the capacity of the planet to sustain us - is to shatter a fundamental modern illusion. The way we've structured our societies depends on the assumption that progress is infinite, that there is always a way forward, that if we just innovate hard enough, no problem will be impossible to overcome. This is not a neutral worldview - it is an ideology, a faith in technological salvation so deeply ingrained that we barely recognize it for what it is.</p>
        
        <p>And yet, history offers no examples of infinite solutions. Every civilization that ignored ecological limits paid the price. The Mayans, once rulers of vast city-states, collapsed after deforestation and drought drained their agricultural capacity. The people of Easter Island, in their pursuit of progress, felled the very trees that sustained them, sealing their fate. The Norse settlements in Greenland perished as they clung to unsustainable (European) farming practices rather than adapting to their environment. The natural world is governed by constraints, and so are we - whether we acknowledge them or not.</p>
        
        <p>Strangely enough, we readily accept limits in most areas of life. We don't expect a tree to grow to the sky, a single cow to produce infinite milk, or a human body to run without sleep. We design airplanes according to the laws of physics, not wishful thinking. We acknowledge biological limits in medicine. But when it comes to growth, technology, and consumption, we tell ourselves that limits are an illusion.</p>
        
        <p>This contradiction is absurd, and yet it governs how we approach the most pressing crises of our time. Climate change? Technology will fix it. Energy shortages? Innovation is always just around the corner. Social collapse? Surely AI will manage it. Even when there is no evidence that these solutions will arrive in time - or at all - we double down. The mere suggestion that we should reduce consumption, restructure economies, or embrace a slower pace of life is met with hostility. To say that we cannot sustain infinite growth is treated as radical. But what, exactly, is radical about acknowledging reality?</p>
        
        <p>The biggest irony is that technological fundamentalism disguises itself as rationality. It presents itself as pragmatic, forward-thinking, the only reasonable stance. Meanwhile, those who argue for caution, for recognizing limits, for designing a world that operates within planetary boundaries, are dismissed as naive or defeatist. But look around - who is really being irrational? The person who suggests we adapt to the world as it is, or the one who insists we can keep sprinting toward collapse because something will eventually save us?</p>
        
        <p>The most common response to these concerns is a casual shrug: "We'll figure it out". Or worse, "The market will take care of it." But how does one come to such a conclusion with certainty? Where is the evidence that innovation will always arrive just in time, precisely when we need it? This is faith, not reason. And it's an incredibly dangerous gamble.</p>
        
        <p>To be clear, this is not an argument against technology itself. The wheel, the printing press, vaccines, renewable energy - human innovation has brought extraordinary progress. But not all technology is good technology. Not all progress is meaningful progress. A decentralized solar grid that empowers local communities is not the same as AI systems optimizing hedge fund profits at planetary cost. The question is not whether we should innovate, but why, how, and for whom. What if we innovated to slow down, rather than speed up? What if our goal was not productivity, but sufficiency, not extraction, but regeneration? Are we creating solutions that actually improve human well-being, or are we just inventing ways to sustain an unsustainable system a little longer?</p>
        
        <p>And even if these innovations were meaningful, we must also ask: Who pays the price for them, and who benefits? The minerals that fuel our digital optimism - lithium, cobalt, rare earths - are not extracted in a vacuum. They come at a cost, and that cost is often borne by communities far from Silicon Valley or Brussels. The same technologies we hope will save us are built on extractive practices that echo old colonial patterns: environmental degradation in the Global South, so the North can maintain the illusion of clean progress. For many, collapse is not a distant threat. It is a present reality.</p>
        
        <p>Ignoring limits does not make them disappear. The belief that we can expand infinitely, consume endlessly, and outthink nature itself has no scientific basis. In fact, each crisis we face seems to trigger a cycle of doubling down. More climate chaos? Invest in geoengineering. Economic instability? Push for AI-driven efficiency. Social unrest? Deploy surveillance tools. But these responses rarely address the root cause. They deepen the same habits that led us here in the first place. We are patching a sinking ship with faster engines. What does have a basis in reality is the trajectory we are on: rising temperatures, collapsing biodiversity, resource depletion, and social instability. If we continue at this pace, collapse is not a distant possibility - it is a certainty. And ‘collapse' may not look like a Hollywood apocalypse but like water rationing, food price spikes, rising authoritarianism, and fraying social trust. The real unknown is whether the technological solutions we are waiting for will arrive in time.</p>
        
        <p>And if they don't? What then?</p>
        
        <p>This is the fundamental question that technological fundamentalism refuses to ask. It is a belief system that bets everything on the unknown, while dismissing the certainty of the crisis at hand. That is not pragmatism. It is a dangerous illusion.</p>
        
        <p>It's not hard to see why we cling to these beliefs. The idea that technology will save us offers comfort in a disoriented world. It tells us we don't have to change our lives, our economies, our values. It lets us imagine we can solve planetary crises without confronting power or privilege. But comfort is not a substitute for truth. The longer we hide behind the fantasy of inevitable innovation, the harder the landing becomes.</p>
        
        <p>If there is one lesson history teaches us, it is that those who acknowledge limits survive. Those who ignore them do not. The choice before us is simple: adapt to reality, or continue chasing a fantasy until it all falls apart. If we are serious about survival - not just as individuals, but as a species - it is time to start designing a world that does not rely on miracles, no matter how emotionally comforting they may be.</p>
