                I am currently writing my master's thesis at JKU Linz on the relationships and backgrounds of those who authored or co-authored EU policy documents on AI and technological advancements, with a focus on potential conflicts of interest regarding the EU's sustainability goals. I have completed all my master's exams - the thesis is the last step, which I plan to finish this year.

                As part of the Local Development Association in my hometown, we are about to submit our LEADER-funded project proposal to restore and re-map local hiking trails. The project combines environmental regeneration, soft tourism, and community-led land stewardship - a chance to revive cultural landscapes while strengthening biodiversity.

                I am currently looking for opportunities to contribute to public talks and interdisciplinary discussions on AI, progress, and society.

        <ul>
	        <li>
                I just finished Ishmael by Daniel Quinn, which I absolutely loved for its radical, yet resonating perspective on human history and civilization.
            </li>
            <li>
                Currently I am reading "How Can I Help? Saving Nature with Your Yard" by Douglas W. Tallamy. I enjoy this book for how much I learn about ecology, ecosystems, local food webs, and gardening. I plan to apply its principles next year, when I move into my new flat in my hometown with a yard of my own.
            </li>
            <li>
                I also recently subscribed to <em>New Internationalist</em> and <em>Resurgence & Ecologist</em>.
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>New Internationalist</em> broadens my worldview with refreshing, international perspectives on global matters â€“ I'd recommend it to anyone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Resurgence & Ecologist</em> is different: niche, slow, and deeply calming. I love reading it with my feet in the grass, as it helps me disconnect from the constant dilemmas of the present and immerse myself in stories about nature.
