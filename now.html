        <ul>
            <li>Preparing for my contribution at the EC2U Student Forum in Coimbra on how techno-solutionism distracts from structural issues - and how local communities can reclaim agency in digital transitions.</li>
            <li>Working on my master's thesis, which explores the ecological consequences of lithium mining for AI infrastructure - with planned fieldwork in Chile to contrast material realities with Western AI narratives.</li>
            <li>Writing an essay about how digital tools reshape our perception of time, urgency, and the idea of 'catching up.'</li>
            <li>Still thinking a lot about limits - ecological, cognitive, and societal - and how systems design often ignores them entirely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">What I'm Reading</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently reading <i>The Demon-Haunted World</i> by Carl Sagan - a book I admire deeply for its clarity, rationality, and belief in the public's right to understand and question science.</li>
            <li>Next on my list: either re-reading Jason Hickel's <i>The Divide</i>, which radically reshaped how I see global inequality, or starting <i>Ishmael</i> by Daniel Quinn - a philosophical novel that challenges the very foundations of civilization and our assumptions about progress.</li>
            <li>I'm also exploring two new magazines: <i>The Internationalist</i> and <i>Resurgence & Ecologist</i>, both of which offer insightful alternatives to mainstream narratives around development, ecology, and justice.</li>
