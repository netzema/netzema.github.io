        <ul>
            <li>Preparing for my contribution at the EC2U Student Forum in Coimbra on how techno-solutionism distracts from structural issues - and how local communities can reclaim agency in digital transitions. I'll contribute to the discussions on "the role of arts, media and communication". </li>
            <li>Just finished a workshop on complex networks by the Internationale Akademie Traunkirchen. I had the chance to listen to inspiring talks about complexity science and state-of-the-art research in this area, including contributions from Stefan Thurner, Peter Klimek, Fariba Karimi, and Wendy Hui Kyong Chun.</li>
            <li>I changed my master thesis topic and now want to explore the relationships and backgrounds of those who authored or co-authored EU policy documents on AI and technological advancements, investigating potential conflicts of interest with the EU's sustainability goals.</li>
            <li>As part of the Local Development Association, we are preparing a LEADER-funded project (EU-funded) to restore and re-map local hiking trails - a blend of environmental regeneration, soft tourism, and community-led land stewardship.</li>
            <li>I am currently looking for opportunities to contribute to public talks and interdisciplinary discussions on AI, progress, and society.</li>
            <li>I'm thinking about what to do after my AI Master's. Two particular (non-mutually exclusive) things on my mind: trying to start a PhD with the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna; or starting a gardening education.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">What I'm Reading</h2>
        <ul>
	    <li>Currently reading <i>Ishmael</i> by Daniel Quinn and enjoying it a lot.</li>
            <li>Just finished reading <i>The Demon-Haunted World</i> by Carl Sagan - a book I admire deeply for its clarity, rationality, and belief in the public's right to understand and question science.</li>
            <li>Next on my list: either re-reading Jason Hickel's <i>The Divide</i>, which radically reshaped how I see global inequality, or starting <i>How can I help?</i> by Douglas W. Tallamy - a book on how everyone of us can save nature with their own yard.</li>
            <li>I'm also exploring two new magazines: <i>The Internationalist</i> and <i>Resurgence & Ecologist</i>, both of which offer alternatives to mainstream narratives around development, ecology, and justice.</li>
